      The large marketbag is perfect for visiting the farmers market or grocery store, but can be used for much more!<br>
      Use it for a day on the beach, to carry your books, anything you need.<br><br>
      Machine wash cold on gentle and tumble dry low or lay flat to dry.<br>
      Bags are available in a variety of colors and combinations.  I also offer custom dyed options.<br><br>
      Straps measure 36 in long.  Bag measures 12 in deep and 20 in wide when laying flat.  Mesh pattern allows for some stretch when it comes to carrying capacity.
